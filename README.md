# American-Standoff
A two-player American political trivia game made in light of the 2016 American elections. I designed a game with a peer using the object-oriented programming paradigm where two players compete in a trivia and action-based battle. We incorporated Pygame for the front-end such as using sprites for players, and ensured easier user accessibility such as implementing both keyboard and mouse controls. Python was utilized for the back-end and created classes such as the Player class and Bullet class.
